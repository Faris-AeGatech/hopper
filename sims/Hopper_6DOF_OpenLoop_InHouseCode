This Simulink model implements the open-loop 6-DOF rigid-body dynamics for the hopper configuration. It accepts four control inputs—main thrust, pitch TVC, yaw TVC, and an RCS-based roll control command—and provides the complete 6-DOF state vector, including inertial position, body-frame velocity, quaternion attitude, and body angular rates. A thorough sanity-check and validation of the model configuration and parameters is strongly recommended prior to any operational or analytical use.
